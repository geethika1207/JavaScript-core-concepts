# JavaScript Core Concepts

This repository contains my daily practice while learning core JavaScript fundamentals.
Each file focuses on one concept and is committed separately to build consistency and
improve code reading and writing skills.

## Contents
- `variables.js` – variables, data types, and basic string methods
- `arrays.js` – array creation and common array operations
- `objects.js` – object literals and property access
- `loops.js` – loops and iteration patterns
- `functions.js` – function declarations and arrow functions
- `dom.js` – basic DOM selection and manipulation

## Purpose
- Strengthen JavaScript fundamentals
- Practice writing small, focused code changes
- Maintain consistent GitHub activity
- Prepare for frontend development and open-source contributions

## Notes
- This is a learning repository, not production code
- Commits are intentionally small and incremental
