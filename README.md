# JavaScript Core Concepts

After building a few exploratory projects, I realized the need for a stronger foundation and
deliberately shifted to learning JavaScript in depth through small, consistent exercises.
This repository documents my focused practice while strengthening core JavaScript fundamentals.

Each file covers a single concept and is committed separately to build discipline, improve
code-reading ability, and prepare for real-world codebases and open-source contributions.

## Contents
- `variables.js` – variables, data types, and basic string methods  
- `arrays.js` – array creation and common array operations  
- `objects.js` – object literals and property access  
- `loops.js` – loops and iteration patterns  
- `functions.js` – function declarations and arrow functions  
- `dom.js` – basic DOM selection and manipulation  

## Purpose
- Build a strong JavaScript foundation
- Practice writing small, focused, reviewable changes
- Develop consistency with Git and GitHub
- Prepare for frontend development and open-source contribution workflows

## Notes
- This is a learning-focused repository, not production code
- Commits are intentionally small and incremental
